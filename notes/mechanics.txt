Fighting

Level up grants you +2 points to spend in Grit, Finesse, or Savvy. You start with zero.

STATS:
- Grit      = (STR + CON). Affects health. Damage focused items.
- Finesse   = (DEX). Affects dodge. Accuracy focused items.
- Savvy     = (CHA + INT + WIS). Affects social/surviving and instruments.

SKILLS (combat):
- Shotguns, cudgels = Grit
- Rifles, Blades    = Finesse
- Pistols, Unarmed  = Finesse OR Grit (higher of the two)
- Dodge             = Finesse
- Health            = Grit

WEAPON MATH:
- ToHit          = d6 + Weapon Skill + Weapon Accuracy Mod
- Damage         = Weapon Dmg Die + Weapon Skill
- AC             = d6 + Dodge Skill
- If ToHit > AC, then deal Damage
- Maximum Health = 20 + ((Lvl + Grit) * 10)

NOTES:
- Items can grant bonus to skills. I,E, boots can grant +1 Dodge,
- a Duster can grant +3 "Health" skill (+30hp)
- Some gloves can grant +2 Unarmed Skill (etc.)
- Finesse-based will typically have higher accuracy
- Grit-based will typically have higher base damage
- Some items may be special (Whips, Lassos)

Example:
- Player has 3 Grit
- Player has +2 ShotgunSkill from hat
- Player total ShotgunSkill is 3 + 2 = 5
- Player is wielding a rusty shotgun with -2 accuracy and d10+0 dmg
- Player ToHit = d6 + ShotgunSkill + Accuracy = d6 + (5 - 2) = = d6 + 3
- Player Damage = d10 + ShotgunSkill = d10 + 5
- Enemy has 2 Finesse
- Enemy has +1 DodgeSkill from boots, +3 from Duster
- Enemy total DodgeSkill is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6
- hit = d6 + 3 > 6
- dmg = d10 + 5
