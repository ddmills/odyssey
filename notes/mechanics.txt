Fighting

Level up grants you +2 points to spend in Grit, Finesse, or Savvy. You start with zero.

STATS:
- Grit      = Affects health. Damage focused items.
- Finesse   = Affects dodge. Accuracy focused items.
- Savvy     = Affects social/surviving and instruments.

SKILLS (combat):
- Shotguns, cudgels = Grit
- Rifles, Blades    = Finesse
- Pistols, Unarmed  = Finesse OR Grit (higher of the two)
- Dodge             = Finesse
- Health            = Grit

WEAPONS:
- Damage    = Damage die (i.e, d6, d10)
- DamageMod = Bonus number added to the damage roll
- Accuracy  = Bonus number added to the "toHit" roll
- Family    = What type of weapon (i.e, "Cudgel", "Pistol")

WEAPON MATH:
- ToHit          = d6 + WeaponSkill + Weapon Accuracy Mod
- Dodge          = d6 + DodgeSkill
- Damage         = Weapon Dmg Die + Weapon Skill
- If ToHit >= Dodge, then deal Damage
- Maximum Health = 10 + ((Lvl + Grit) * 10)

NOTES:
- Rolling a "6" on your ToHit roll will be a critical (cannot be dodged)
- Items can grant bonus to skills. I,E, boots can grant +1 Dodge,
- a Duster can grant +3 "Health" skill (+30hp)
- Some gloves can grant +2 Unarmed Skill (etc.)
- Finesse-based will typically have higher accuracy
- Grit-based will typically have higher base damage
- Some items may be special (Whips, Lassos)

Example:
- Player has 3 Grit
- Player has +2 ShotgunSkill from hat
- Player total ShotgunSkill is 3 + 2 = 5
- Player is wielding a rusty shotgun with -2 WeaponAccuracy and d10+0 dmg
- Player ToHit = d6 + ShotgunSkill + WeaponAccuracy = d6 + (5 - 2) = d6 + 3
- Player Damage = d10 + ShotgunSkill = d10 + 5
- Enemy has 2 Finesse
- Enemy has +1 DodgeSkill from boots, +3 from Duster
- Enemy total DodgeSkill is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6
- Enemy dodge = d6 + DodgeSkill = d6 + 6
- hit? = (toHit >= dodge) = (d6 + 3) > (d6 + 6)
- dmg = d10 + 5

Dragging
- on "Drag" command, ask for direction
- find neighboring Draggable components
- in Drag mode, it costs extra move
- cannot attack
- when you move, drag items follow


Combat 2
- stat values correlates to a number of d10 dice equal to its value (STR 3 equals 3d10)
- each die that rolls to exceed a threshold value (which can be influenced, but starts at... 7?), each die that succesfully equals or exceeds the threshold generates a success.
- the side with the most successes wins, if defender wins they take no damage, if attacker wins they inflict damage.
- damage could be modified by the number of extra successes over the defender
- weapons themselves might hold threshold altering effects (a pistol might give +1 to dodging, reducing dodging thresholds to a 6 instead of 7)

Mounts
- While on a mount, your accuracy decreases


Lighting/Vision
- Calculate lighting first
- Cast player vision at full size
- On "vision" callback, if distance > vision distance, check if tile has some light first (!) else

Sleeping
- sleep until dawn
- sleep for 8 hours
- sleep for 6 hours
- sleep for 4 hours
- sleep for 2 hours
