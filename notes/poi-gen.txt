POI - Point Of Interest


Need to have multiple levels of POI:

PRIMARY
	- Buffered by at least 2 zone
	- ex: Starting towns, static known locations
MAJOR
	- Buffered by at least 2 zone
	- ex: Hidden towns, forts, bandit hideouts, ruin complex
MEDIUM
	- Buffered by at least 1 zone
	- ex: Ruins, Bandit camp, pioneer cabin
MINOR
	- No rules on where they can be placed
	- ex: Bear cave, shrines, Broken wagon, Wolf Den



1. Primary POIs are always in the same location. Place these on the map.
2. Do three passes of poisson disc on the map (major, medium, minor)
3. Cull points around primary, major, and then medium
4. For each point, ask the biome for a POI

1. When the player explores a POI, we generated it 
2. Tell the POI generator the biome type 
3. POI generator can then use the biome info (monsters, foliage, loot, etc) to populate it



A POI will have:

1. Name 
2. Location 
3. Layout 
4. Rooms 
5. Tile Overrides 
6. Bool (is Generated)
7. Possible Save/Load POIs as needed from disk
