Difficulty

- Each zone will have a difficulty tier (1-n)
- Each biome type will have different monsters associated with each tier
- monster difficulty scales with tier, not player
- important to keep monster behavior/difficulty static based on appearance
	(i.e, if two monsters _look_ the same, they should always be the same difficulty)
- as player progresses, potentially litter in a few more deadly monsters in lower tiers
- areas of different difficulty should be separated by land features?
