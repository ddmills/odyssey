Difficulty

New plan:

- Each biome has a difficulty tier (1-n)
- If multiple tiers are needed, a new biome will be created. I.E, Forest -> Primeval Pines -> Haunted Woods, etc
- Each biome will have weighted tables or lists for
	- Major POIs (Town, Ruin complex, Fort)
	- Medium POIs (Bandit camp, Pioneer Cabin)
	- Minor POIs (Bear den, Shrine, Broken Wagon)
	- Monsters
	- Rare monsters
	- Loot/Litter
	- Rock/Cliff Type
	- Common Foliage
	- Litter
- Biomes may need to track how many of each POI type has been created
	- (i.e, after spawning, remove the POI from the weighted table, or reduce it's weight)



Old plan:

- Each zone will have a difficulty tier (1-n)
- Each biome type will have different monsters associated with each tier
- monster difficulty scales with tier, not player
- important to keep monster behavior/difficulty static based on appearance
	(i.e, if two monsters _look_ the same, they should always be the same difficulty)
- as player progresses, potentially litter in a few more deadly monsters in lower tiers
- areas of different difficulty should be separated by land features?
