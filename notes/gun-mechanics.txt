Gun Mechanics
=============

Each gun will belong to a weapon family, which you can get a skill to boost the stats associated with it.


Attributes that can be tweaked:
- Range
- Accuracy (%)
- Damage
- Reload speed
- Firing rate
- Clip size
- Ammo type
- on-handed, two-handed
- on-crit effects
- On-hit effects (poison, knockback, stun, burn)
- Footprint (AOE - Point, Line, Circle, Cone)
- Bullets per shot


How gun types should feel:
- Rifles: Powerful, long range, accurate, slow
- Shotguns, Powerful, Short range, innacurate, fast
- Pistols: Quick, Mix of the two





Question:
How should shooting work when you have two guns equipped?
	- Alternate?
	- Decrease accuracy, and shot-cost?
	- Fire at same time, second gun has decreased accuracy
	- Energy cost for shooting two weapons...? Highest of the two? Avg of the two? Sum? Primary gun cost?

Can you shoot outside of the gun range?
